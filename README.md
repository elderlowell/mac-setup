# mac-setup
A command-line script to setup a new mac computer. For me, there are 2 variations:

- One for work setup
- One for personal setup

## Installation
To run the work setup script, open a terminal and run the command:
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elderlowell/mac-setup/main/work-setup"
```

To run the personal setup script, open a terminal and run the command:
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elderlowell/mac-setup/main/personal-setup"
```
